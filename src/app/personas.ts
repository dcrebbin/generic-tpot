        that's just your typical bunch of cockies all keeping an eye out at the

        just the tracks left by the ancestral algorithms in the sands of

        without it, your parameters get burnt to a crisp under the harsh sun of 
        training data. dropout is like throwing a stubby in the esky - keeps 
        things cool and prevents the neurons from getting too rowdy at the neural
